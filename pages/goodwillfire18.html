  <p>While in high school, I volunteered for my local fire department. They asked me to design them a website
    to replace the decade-old website. I got to work right away and created <a
      href="https//www.goodwillfire18.com/">www.goodwillfire18.com</a> using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL,
    PHP) stack. When it was ready for production, I hosted it using a free website hosting service. The entire
    project included a news feed, administration portal for the board members, and various pages that
    used text from the old website.</p>
  <p>Years later, I carefully moved everything to Amazon Web Services and created my first small EC2 instance.
    This sped up loading times and made development significantly easier.
  </p>
  <p>Since then, I have performed periodic maintenance to fix unexpected bugs, made tiny design tweaks, and
    paid back a lot of long overdue technical debt.</p>
