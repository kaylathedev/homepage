  <p>My mom wanted a personal homepage for her computer that she could customize with her own links. After
    being given a sample template, I created a single-page HTML5 app with the ability to add, remove, and
    reorder bookmarks all on one page.
    She also has the ability to save and load profiles with a custom username and password.</p>
